# MISA

I built MISA because I didn’t want to manage a Zettelkasten by hand. I didn’t want to worry about tags, links, formats, or whether things were structured “correctly”. I wanted a system that could take care of structure and consistency for me, and help me see where I understand things well and where I don’t.

While the current focus is on task planning and scheduling, the long-term direction is to work with connected knowledge and topics that can evolve over time.

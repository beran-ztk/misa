# MISA

MISA is a personal meta-organization and orchestration system.
Its purpose is to make work, knowledge, and decisions explicitly modelable, traceable, and evolvable over time.

Rather than managing isolated tasks or notes, MISA focuses on how things relate to each other, depend on one another, and progress through defined states.

## Concept & Direction

MISA models all work and knowledge as Items with explicit lifecycles, states, and dependencies. These Items can represent tasks, topics, decisions, sessions, or any other unit of work or thought.

A central calendar acts as an orchestration layer rather than a simple scheduler. It coordinates when and how Items progress, interact, or trigger follow-up actions.

Long-term, MISA aims to become a critically evaluable, Zettelkasten-like knowledge system, where ideas, work units, and decisions can be reviewed, revised, and connected across time.

# MISA

MISA is a personal orchestration system for work, knowledge, and decisions.

It models tasks, schedules, projects, topics, sources, and priorities as connected entities rather than isolated tools. Instead of manually maintaining structure, MISA is designed to make structure explicit, evaluable, and evolvable over time.

Tasks, initiatives, knowledge indices, sources, and feeds share a common execution and prioritization model. This allows actions, scheduling, evaluation, and context to interact consistently across domains.

The long-term goal of MISA is to support autonomous agents and decision-making systems that operate on the user’s knowledge, policies, and priorities, using the full system state as context.

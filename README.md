# MISA

MISA is a personal meta-organization and orchestration system.
Its purpose is to make work, knowledge, and decisions explicit, traceable, and evolvable over time.

Rather than managing isolated tasks or notes, MISA focuses on how things relate to each other, depend on one another, and progress through defined states.

## Concept

MISA models all work and knowledge as Items with explicit lifecycles, states, and dependencies. Items can represent tasks, topics, decisions, sessions, or any other unit of work or thought.

The scheduler functions as an orchestration layer, not merely a notification mechanism, coordinating timing, state transitions, and follow-up actions across items.

## Direction

Long-term, MISA aims to become a critically evaluable, Zettelkasten-like knowledge system, where ideas, work units, and decisions can be reviewed, revised, and connected across time.

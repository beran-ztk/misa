# MISA

MISA is a personal meta-organization and orchestration system.
Its purpose is to make work, knowledge, and decisions explicitly modelable, traceable, and evolvable over time.

Instead of managing isolated tasks or notes, MISA focuses on controlling how things relate, depend on each other, and progress.

## Concept & Direction

MISA models all work and knowledge as Items with explicit lifecycles, states, and dependencies. These Items can represent tasks, topics, decisions, sessions, or any other unit of work or thought.

A central calendar is used as an orchestration layer, not as a simple scheduler. It coordinates when and how Items progress, interact, or trigger follow-up actions.

Long-term, MISA aims to function as a critically evaluable, Zettelkasten-like knowledge system where ideas, work units, and decisions can be reviewed, revised, and connected across time.

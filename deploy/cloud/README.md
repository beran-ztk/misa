# Resona Cloud

The compose stack runs PostgreSQL, the Resona ASP.NET Core API, and the Python/Essentia analysis API. Both APIs are bound to localhost so a reverse proxy can provide public HTTPS without exposing the container ports directly.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the database password.
2. Run `docker compose up -d --build` from this directory.
3. Verify both services:
   - `curl http://127.0.0.1:5080/health`
   - `curl http://127.0.0.1:5081/health`
4. Put Caddy, nginx, or another TLS reverse proxy in front of ports 5080 and 5081. Separate subdomains such as `api.example.com` and `analyzer.example.com` keep the proxy configuration simple.

For nginx, the API virtual host must allow the same 256 MB per-track request size as the ASP.NET Core server. Add this inside the `server` block for the Resona API and reload nginx:

```nginx
client_max_body_size 256m;
```

Without this setting nginx uses its much smaller default limit and full-library synchronization returns HTTP 413 (`Request Entity Too Large`).

## Public library API

The public read endpoints require no device credentials. List responses are ordered deterministically and use `offset`/`limit` pagination. The default limit is 50 and the maximum is 100.

```text
GET /api/v1/public/profiles?search=&offset=0&limit=50
GET /api/v1/public/profiles/{userId}
GET /api/v1/public/profiles/{userId}/image
GET /api/v1/public/profiles/{userId}/tracks?search=&offset=0&limit=50
```

After deploying, these commands provide a quick production check:

```bash
curl -sS 'https://api.resona-music.de/api/v1/public/profiles?limit=10'
curl -sS 'https://api.resona-music.de/api/v1/public/profiles/USER_ID'
curl -sS 'https://api.resona-music.de/api/v1/public/profiles/USER_ID/tracks?limit=10'
curl -fS 'https://api.resona-music.de/api/v1/public/profiles/USER_ID/image' -o profile.jpg
```

Profile search matches username and bio. Track search matches edited title, original title, and channel name. Missing profiles return HTTP 404; invalid pagination returns HTTP 400.

The schema is created idempotently at API startup. PostgreSQL data lives in the `postgres-data` volume. Uploaded audio lives in the `resona-media` volume. Back up both volumes before upgrades; use `pg_dump` for PostgreSQL.

## Private device-library synchronization

The authenticated device API keeps one replaceable metadata snapshot and a persistent inventory of individually uploaded audio files:

```text
PUT /api/v1/device-library-snapshot
GET /api/v1/device-library-snapshot
GET /api/v1/library-media
PUT /api/v1/library-media/{trackKey}
GET /api/v1/library-media/{trackKey}
```

Audio uploads are atomic and recorded only after the complete file has been written and hashed. Downloads support HTTP range requests. The desktop compares its local library with `GET /api/v1/library-media` and uploads only missing files, so interrupted initial synchronization resumes on the next application start.

The analyzer intentionally runs one analysis at a time by default because TensorFlow inference is memory intensive. It returns MAEST genre scores, BPM, EBU R128 loudness/dynamics, and the MIREX emotional-character clusters used by Resona. Increase `MAX_CONCURRENT_ANALYSES` only after checking memory usage on the server.

`MUSIC_API_KEY` is optional. When it is configured, enter the same value under **Settings → Servers → Analysis server → API key** in Resona Desktop. The client sends it as `X-Api-Key`. If no key is configured, keep the analyzer behind a trusted proxy, VPN, or restricted network instead of exposing it openly to the internet.

## Local HTTPS deployment

The compose stack includes an nginx proxy and CoreDNS for installations that use a locally trusted certificate. Both services use HTTPS port `443`; nginx routes `api.resona.home.arpa` to the cloud API and `analyzer.resona.home.arpa` to the analyzer. CoreDNS resolves these private names and forwards other queries to the local router. The backend HTTP ports `5080` and `5081` remain available only on the server loopback interface.

Place the server certificate and private key at `deploy/cloud/tls/server.crt` and `deploy/cloud/tls/server.key`. The certificate must contain every hostname used by clients as a Subject Alternative Name. Trust its issuing CA on each client device, configure `192.168.178.102` as the client's DNS server, then configure Resona with `https://api.resona.home.arpa` and `https://analyzer.resona.home.arpa`. Pasting either service's `/health` URL is also accepted by the desktop app and normalized to the base address.
